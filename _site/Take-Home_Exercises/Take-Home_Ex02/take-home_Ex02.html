<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenge-overview-vast-challenge-2023">1 Challenge Overview (<a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2023/">VAST Challenge 2023</a>)</h2>
<p>Seafood is one of the most widely traded commodities in the global food market. More than a third of the world’s population relies on fish and other seafood as a primary source of protein in their diet, and an estimated 520 million people make their livelihoods through fishing or fishing-related activities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a major contributor to over fishing worldwide. These activities pose a threat not only to fragile marine ecosystems, but also to food security in coastal communities and regional stability more broadly. The illegal fishing trade has been linked to organized crime, and human rights violations are common when fishing operations are conducted without regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>The country of Oceanus has sought FishEye International’s help in identifying companies possibly engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Using visual analytics, this challenge will sought to help FishEye identify companies that may be engaged in illegal fishing.</p>
<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">1.1 Data</h3>
<p>The data used for this exercises will be from Mini Challenge 2 of the VAST Challenge. This includes 2 main files; the first dataset in json format consists of 34,552 nodes and 5,464,092 directed edges, while the second set of files, a bundle of 12, each represent the output of an AI program for link reference Each bundle represents a list of potential edges to add to the main graph. Details of the attributes provided are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Node:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id:</strong> Name of the company that originated (or received) the shipment</li>
<li><strong>shpcountry:</strong> Country the company most often associated with when shipping</li>
<li><strong>rcvcountry:</strong> Country the company most often associated with when receiving</li>
<li><strong>dataset:</strong> Always ‘MC2’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>arrivaldate:</strong> Date the shipment arrived at port in YYYY-MM-DD format.</li>
<li><strong>hscode:</strong> Harmonized System code for the shipment. Can be joined with the hscodes table to get additional details.</li>
<li><strong>valueofgoods_omu:</strong> Customs-declared value of the total shipment, in Oceanus Monetary Units (OMU)</li>
<li><strong>volumeteu:</strong> The volume of the shipment in ‘Twenty-foot equivalent units’, roughly how many 20-foot standard containers would be required. (Actual number of containers may have been different as there are 20ft and 40ft standard containers and tankers that do not use containers)</li>
<li><strong>weightkg:</strong> The weight of the shipment in kilograms (if known)</li>
<li><strong>dataset:</strong> Always ‘MC2’</li>
<li><strong>type:</strong> Always ‘shipment’ for MC2</li>
<li><strong>generated_by:</strong> Name of the program that generated the edge. (Only found on ‘bundle’ records.)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">1.2 Objectives</h3>
<p>The main objective of this exercise is to use visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records, and categorize the types of business relationship patterns.</p>
<p>Specifically, this piece will take a different lens and zoom into outlier companies with exceptionally high shipment weights, to try to uncover business patterns.</p>

<p>Next we will convert the file into tibble format using <code>as_tibble</code>. The <em>‘<strong>nodes’</strong> list will be saved as’</em><strong>MC2_nodes’</strong><em>, and</em> ’<strong>links’</strong> list as <em>’<strong>MC2_edges’</strong></em>. The variables in the lists will also be re-ordered to facilitate subsequent visualization tasks. The details are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>MC2_nodes:</strong> id, shpcountry, rcvcountry</p>
<p><strong>MC2_edges:</strong> source, target,arrivaldate, hscode, weightkg, valueofgoods_omu, valueofgoodsusd, volumeteu</p>

<ul>
<li>arrivaldate in <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> format, should be transformed to <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> format</li>
<li>large proportions of missing data, recorded as ‘NA’ or ‘0’ under valueofgoods_omu, valueofgoodsusd and volumeteu.</li>

<p>The output report of ‘MC2_edges’ above reveals that the ‘arrivaldate’ is treated as ‘Character’ data type instead of date data type. This is an error! Before we continue, it is important for us to change the data type of ‘arrivaldate’ field back to ‘Date’ data type.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To correct the data type for ‘arrivaldate’ we will use the ymd() function of lubridate package. Additionally, we will create 3 new columns to extract the year month, year and month data from ‘arrivaldate’. Doing so will allow us to look at broader and seasonal patterns, if any, in subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>A close examination of the ’<strong>MC2_edges_unique’</strong> dataframe reveals that it consists of individual transactions. This is not very useful for visualisation.</p>
<p>In view of this, we will aggregate the rows in two ways. First by source, target and year, and second by source, target and yearmonth. To do so, we will use the following 4 functions from dplyr package; <code>filter()</code>, <code>group()</code>, <code>summarise()</code>, and <code>ungroup()</code>.</p>
<p>The 2 new dataframes, edges_ym and edges_y, will also include of the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight: Number of shipments between two entities</li>
<li>sumweightkg = Total weight of products for all shipments</li>
<li>avg_weight_per_shipment: Average weight of products per shipment (sumweightkg/weight)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>glimpse()</code> to review the new dataframe, we see many relationships having less than handful of shipments between each other. Splitting the values up into quartiles, we see that up to 90% of all links have 10 or less shipments between them on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Looking at the average weight of shipment across the 6 years was quite interesting. Specifically, we see a small proportion of shipments that are transacting way beyond the ‘normal’ weights, with the heaviest going up to 307,800kg. We will filter out companies involved in these transactions and all activities there are associated with to further focus subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>Before plotting the networks. Let’s look at each data set seperately. Using <code>glimspe()</code>, we see that post data cleaning, there are 194 unique nodes involved in outlier transactions in the dataframe aggregated by year month.</p>

<p>Next, we use the count() function to determine the number of companies that are mostly associated to a specific shipping country. This may provide a sense on where a company may have originated from. Dataframe nodes_y_22 will be used for this analyses since there are more nodes relative to nodes_ym_10. A quick view of the data indicates that these companies are associated with 45 different countries.</p>

<p>A bar chart is then plotted for the top five countries among all source firms, and outlier source firms i.e., countries with the most number of ‘outlier’ shipping firms being associated with. Rows with ‘shpcountry’ as ‘Unknown’ were excluded from this analyses.</p>

<p>Looking at the overall chart in orange, considering that there are a total of 59 unique countries, it is interesting to note that the top 5 listed in the bar chart below were associated with approximately half of all companies. These countries are likely the bigger players in the fishing industry.</p>
<p>Notably, some changes to the ranking are observed among firms involved in outlier transactions. Oceanus moves to the top spot, with Mawazam at second. Marebak moves from first to third.</p>

<p>Next, we look at shipment trends by source and target companies over time. One of the telltale signs of illegal fishing is the opening and closing of such companies within short span of time, either because they were caught, or to avoid getting caught.</p>

<p>From the heatmap below, we can identify a few potential source companies to look into. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping S.A. de C.V.: This source node only made 1 transaction over the 6 years; but it’s load was the heaviest.</li>
<li>Saltsea &amp; Inc Carriers: The shipments by this firm is sporadic, with large time breaks in between.</li>
<li>Marine Mates Pic Delivery: The shipments by this firm is sporadic.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these source nodes map out in the overall network.</p>

<p>Next, the nodes and edge datasets are plotting into a network graph using visNetwork. Looking at the overall graph, while there is a clear connected graph in the middle, there are also many isolated nodes. The main network however, is clumped together, and it is not very useful visually for analyses.</p>

<p>From the charts, we can better understand the proportion of key players with a high number of in and out degrees.Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>We see a smaller proportion of nodes with high in-degrees, approximately 20% of all nodes.</li>
<li>This trend is slightly different when we look at out-degree, as we observe a larger proportion of bigger nodes in the circular graph below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those with high in-degree represents companies that take in a lot of shipments, while those with high out-degress are those that delivery many shipments. These nodes are likely key players in the eco-system and act like hubs. However, a large majority of nodes are connected to only a handful of other nodes. This trend was observed in both charts.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this dataset is limited to companies with at least one transaction that is considered an outlier i.e., in larger amounts. While is may not be surprising for ‘hub’ nodes to transact in large amounts, it comes across fishy when small players with few partners are transacting at such large amounts, and to a small number of business partners.</p>

<p>Recall earlier that we identifed a few companies with odd transaction patterns over the years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping S.A. de C.V.: This source node only made 1 transaction over the 6 years; but it’s load was the heaviest.</li>
<li>Saltsea &amp; Inc Carriers: The shipments by this firm is sporadic, with large time breaks in between.</li>
<li>Marine Mates Pic Delivery: The shipments by this firm is sporadic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the scope of this exercise, let’s explore Saltsea &amp; Inc Carriers. Clicking onto the node in the graph, we see the company only has 1 partner, Pao Gan SE Seal. Since this is the only edge on the graph tied to Saltsea &amp; Inc, we will take a closer look at it’s partners to understand business patterns.</p>

<p>Extracting only business partners of Pao Gan SE Seal, we see that the company has multiple partners with long intervals between shipments. To assess if this is common within the industry, we turn to Saltsea &amp; Inc Carriers’ second partner Mar del Este CJSC. It is interesting to note that transaction patterns from both companies reveal similar business patterns i.e., a mix of long term, and short term partners.</p>

<p>Perhaps a additional layer to look at, would be the proportion of ‘outlier’ transactions made by these source nodes.</p>

<p>From the table below, we can see that for the business partners of Pao Gan SE Seal, there were 3 companies where all shipments were heavy and considered outliers. These companies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaltSea &amp; Inc Carriers</li>
<li>Niger River Delta Oyj Abalone, and</li>
<li>Scottish Oysters Flotsam S.p.A. Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>While inconclusive, the trick to catching illegal fishing activities may indeed involve multiple variables.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Looking at the trade dataset, a sizable proportion of businesses trade exceptionally high weight of products. It is crucial that we look at these data points to better understand such occurrences.</p></li>
<li><p>A smaller proportion of nodes with high in-degrees were noted, meaning aside from a few, businesses receiving goods tend to not have as many transactions, relative to those shipping produce. This is in line with findings from our heatmap, as we see many companies shipping throughout the year, across the 6 years.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it is also common for businesses to pause and have long intervals between shipments. While this may come across as suspicious, it is likely insufficient to signal illegal activities. As such, it may be useful to explore other indicators as well, a view them as a group. In this exercise, we studied two indicators transaction patterns and proportion of outlier shipments. Other potential indicators may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of small one-off shipments</p></li>
<li><p>Number of business partners - assuming most would not want to be associated with such activities</p></li>
</ul></li>
